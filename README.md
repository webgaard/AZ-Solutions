# AZ-Solutions

**Developing ideas with an architectural mindset.**

AZ-Solutions is a creative, modular platform focused on architectural thinking — bridging design, identity, and code. This repository contains the foundation of the AZ Portfolio SPA, built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## 🚀 Overview

This project was developed entirely from scratch with the help of **ChatGPT** and **Cursor AI Agents**.  
It follows a minimalist, grid-based layout inspired by architectural precision and clarity.
